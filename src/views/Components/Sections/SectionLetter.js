                    <i>Cogito ergo sum</i> is a Latin philosophical proposition by Ren√© Descartes usually translated into English as "I think, therefore I am". The phrase originally appeared in French as <i>je pense, donc je suis</i> in his Discourse on the Method, so as to reach a wider audience than Latin would have allowed. It appeared in Latin in his later Principles of Philosophy.
